This project uses a Raspberry Pi with a camera module to become an always on, small camera.
Meant to be used attached to glasses, but can fit in a pocket as well.

At the press of a button last few minutes of video are recorded.
The button is soldered to Pins 12 and 6 on a Raspberry Pi 3.
This pin location can be changed in button.py
